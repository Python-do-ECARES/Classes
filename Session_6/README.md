# Session 6: Webscraping
This week exercises are about retrieving data from HTML pages. It is a discipline that requires perseverance and ingenuity as you will often resort to dirty tricks and need a bit of luck to do what you want.

The session will be divided into two parts:

1. The regular exercises during which we'll scrape Wikipedia and Wikiquote pages to retrieve info on the laureates of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. For this, you can use the library `requests`, together with `BeautifulSoup` or any library you are comfortable with.
2. A case that I'll present in class (or at least the start of it, as I'm still working on it) solving a real research problem. I'll showcase `selenium` in this context.

Regarding the solution, I will make no attempt at all at presenting the best way to do it. I'll just show one way to retrieve the data we want, given the environment we operate in. You will see that the final results are not complete nor entirely correct. If you find a solution that is *good enough*, this will already be plenty.

See you in class!
