# Session 4: More on Python's basic

In this session, we will work more specifically on loops and functions. We have two files, both to be open with Jupyter. 

The first one, the regular one (named `exercise_4.ipynb`), shows how to play around with lists of values to simulate a small investment strategy and perform non-parametric Monte-Carlo simulations. The second one, that is optional (and called `ad_fundum_the_programming_case.ipynb`), digs further in the topics of exception handling, recursive functions and Belgian student drinking culture.

The solutions to both of them will be posted.
